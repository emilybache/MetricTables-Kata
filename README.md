Metrics Query Stats
===================

You have a script available that can provide metrics in json format. This is faked using the "fake_metrics_script.py"
You need to write a new script "metrics_query_stats.py" that will process these metrics and print out
tables of data. There are several examples in "examples.txt" showing what the new script should do. 
All the examples make use of the same fake data.

The exercise is to do this using TDD.
